## Description:
This is the 7th project in Udacity's Front-end web developer Nanodegree.
The application is a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

The point of this project is to demonstrate mastery of Javascript, React.js, HTML, CSS and responsive design.

## How to run:
Make sure that you have Node.js installed on your device and then clone the repository.
Navigate to the directory that contains the project and write:
```
npm install
```
once everything is setup run:
```
npm start
```
The browser should automatically open the app.  If it doesn't, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

NOTE: Service worker for this app will only work when the app is in production mode.
## Loading the App in Production Mode:
To run the app in production mode run:
```
npm run build
```
Then navigate to the build directory and start a localhost with python
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
After that navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

## Enjoy.
